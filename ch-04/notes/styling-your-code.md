# Styling Your Code

> Take the time to make your code as easy as possible to read.
> The Python style guide was written with the understanding that code is read more often than it is written.

- **Indentation**
  - PEP 8 recommends that you use *four spaces* per indentation level.
  - make sure your editor is set to insert spaces rather than tabs into your document.
  - Mixing tabs and spaces in your file can cause problems that are very difficult to diagnose.
- **Line Length**
  - Many Python programmers recommend that each line should be less than *80 characters*.
  - The PEP 8 recommends that you limit all of your comments to 72 characters per line.
- **Blank Lines**
  - To group parts of your program visually, use blank lines.
  - Blank lines wonâ€™t affect how your code runs, but they will affect the readability of your code.
