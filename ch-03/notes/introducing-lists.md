## What Is a List?

- A **list** is a collection of items in a particular order.

## How to create a List?

- To create a **List** write the elements between a square brackets ([]) separated by commas (,)

```py
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
print(bicycles) # ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
```

## Accessing Elements in a List

- To access an element in a list, write the name of the list followed by the index of the item enclosed in square brackets.

```py
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
# Access the element by the Index
print(bicycles[0]) # trek
# Or a variable holds the Index
position = 2
print(bicycles[position]) # redline
```
